# Rowdy Creators Tello Drone and Machine Learning Project
Project Description: There are two main goals with this project - learn how to program a Tello Drone and create a Machine Learning Model that can detect and identify wildlife around the UTSA campus.

Tools and Skills: This is a beginner-friendly project. The main tools we will use are Python, TensorFlow,  PyTorch, Docker, and Git. If you are new to these tools go to the resources channel to find some material to help you get familiar.

Mentor: Currently we have no mentors, but if you know any professors who'd be willing to help us out please let me know!
